This branch makes eSpeak an embeddable only library.

This:

   1/  removes the building of everything except libespeak;

   2/  removes the inbuilt logic to handle audio -- a consumer
       must provide their own audio handling;

   3/  removes the async/event code -- a consumer must provide
       their own event handling api;

   4/  simplifies the code and API for embedding in another
       application;

   5/  provide a lower level API to the consumer to offer greater
       flexibility and control of the engine.

The intent here is to:

   1/  make eSpeak just manage the text-to-speech logic (e.g.
       it should not be handling audio output);

   2/  expose finer grained control of the eSpeak engine to the
       consumer of the library (e.g. to support saving phoneme
       output to a data buffer and to add dictionary entries
       dynamically);

   3/  support both the current model and an API that allows
       the consumer to better drive the engine (e.g. when
       handling SSML or ePub documents);

   4/  allow the speech synthesis, voice/dictionary compilation
       and voice editing to go through the same API without
       requiring the use of wxwidgets.
