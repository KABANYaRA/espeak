Only rely on the cainteoir-english dictionary for pronunciations.
    
This is a special branch for testing the completeness of the
cainteoir-english dictionary when used against a document. It
is not meant for day-to-day use (use the english branch instead).
    
The idea here is that:
   1/  en_rules contains no rules!
   2/  en_list contains the words from the cainteoir-english
       dictionary.
   3/  en_extra is empty.
   4/  espeak does not try to spell a word it cannot translate,
       but instead prints out a message.
    
This means you can get the words not referenced in the
cainteoir-english dictionary by running:
    
	cat file | espeak -q 2>&1 | \
		grep -F "word not found" | \
		sed -e "s/word not found: //" | \
		sort | uniq
