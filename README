This branch is used to improve the pronunciation of the English
voice in eSpeak.

The pronunciation data for the English voice is stored in the
cainteoir-english project. Running the:

	make en

command uses the data in cainteoir-english, along with the
dictionary processing script in cainteoir-engine to build
up the dictsource/en_extra file containing the words that
eSpeak mispronounces.

To run the `make en` command, you need both the
cainteoir-engine and cainteoir-english sources at the same
level as espeak:

	cainteoir-engine
	cainteoir-english
	espeak
